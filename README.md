# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Model-for-QA-Bot

# Ask your PDFs
================

This project allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about their content. The project uses Langchain, Open AI, natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract text from the PDF files, split the text into chunks, create embeddings for the chunks, and run a question answering chain to generate responses.

## Approach
------------

The project uses the following approach:

* Extract text from PDF files using PyPDF2.
* Split the extracted text into chunks using a character text splitter.
* Create embeddings for the chunks using OpenAI embeddings.
* Run a question answering chain using the embeddings and the user's question.

# Question Answering App using Langchain and Pinecone

## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit application that uses Langchain and Pinecone to answer questions based on a set of uploaded PDF files.

## Features

* Upload multiple PDF files using Streamlit
* Extract text from each PDF file using PyPDF2
* Preprocess the text data using Langchain
* Generate embeddings using OpenAI API
* Create a Pinecone DB index to store the embeddings
* Answer user questions based on the uploaded PDFs using the Pinecone DB index

## Setup and Usage

### Environment Variables

* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
* `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone DB API key
* `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: Your Pinecone DB environment (e.g., us-east-1)
* `INDEX_NAME`: The name of your Pinecone DB index (e.g., langchainvector)

### Running the App

1. Install the required packages: `streamlit`, `PyPDF2`, `langchain`, and `dotenv`
2. Create a new file `app.py` and copy the code from the provided notebook
3. Run the app using `streamlit run app.py`
4. Upload multiple PDF files using the file uploader
5. Ask a question about the uploaded PDFs using the text input

## Pipeline and Deployment Instructions

The pipeline for this project involves the following steps:

1. Data Ingestion: Upload multiple PDF files using Streamlit
2. Data Processing: Extract text from each PDF file, preprocess the text, and generate embeddings using OpenAI API
3. Indexing: Create a Pinecone DB index to store the embeddings
4. Query Retrieval: Retrieve relevant documents from the Pinecone DB index based on the user's question
5. Answer Generation: Generate an answer to the user's question based on the retrieved documents

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Handling Multiple PDF Files and Extracting Text

* Challenge: Handling multiple PDF files and extracting text from each file
* Solution: Using PyPDF2 to extract text from each PDF file and storing the text in a list

### Challenge 2: Preprocessing Text Data and Generating Embeddings

* Challenge: Preprocessing the text data and generating embeddings using OpenAI API
* Solution: Using Langchain to preprocess the text data and generate embeddings using OpenAI API

### Challenge 3: Creating a Pinecone DB Index and Retrieving Relevant Documents

* Challenge: Creating a Pinecone DB index and retrieving relevant documents
* Solution: Using Pinecone to create a DB index and retrieve relevant documents using cosine similarity search

### Challenge 4: Deploying the App

* Challenge: Deploying the app and setting up environment variables
* Solution: Using Streamlit's deployment features and setting up environment variables using dotenv

## Lessons Learned

* The importance of modular code structure and reusability
* The power of Langchain and Pinecone DB in handling large volumes of text data
* The ease of use and flexibility of Streamlit for frontend development
* The importance of thorough testing and debugging

## Future Improvements

* Improving the accuracy of the model by fine-tuning the embeddings and query retrieval
* Adding more features to the app, such as summarization and sentiment analysis
* Exploring other use cases for the app, such as question answering for other types of documents

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Ask Your PDFs project is a powerful tool that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about their content. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract text from the PDF files, split the text into chunks, create embeddings for the chunks, and run a question answering chain to generate responses.
